<p>Lord Paramashiva, the all-knowing, all-powerful superconscious divinity, has revealed the Source Hindu scriptures over 60,000 years ago, as the ultimate authority on eternal Truth. As the Vision documents for humanity, the Hindu scriptures scientifically and systematically reveal all knowledge currents (jnana), ritual methodologies (kriya), lifestyle systems (charya) and Yogic sciences (yoga), establishing the complete science of the most evolved civilization on earth â€“ the enlightened civilization.
