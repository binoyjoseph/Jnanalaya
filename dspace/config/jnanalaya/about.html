<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>विद्या नाम नरस्य रूपमधिकम् प्रच्छन्नगुप्तम् धनम् विद्या भोगकरी यशस्सुखकरी विद्या गुरूणाम् गुरूः |</p>
<p>विद्या बन्धुजनो विदेशगमने विद्याम् परम् दैवतम् |</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>vidyā nāma narasya rūpamadhikam pracchannaguptam dhanam vidyā bhogakarī yaśassukhakarī vidyā gurūṇām gurūḥ |</p>
<p>vidyā bandhujano videśagamane vidyām param daivatam |</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sacred Knowledge is human&rsquo;s ultimate beauty, the hidden treasure. Through knowledge, one can enjoy different happiness, success and it is the Master of all masters. During foreign travel, knowledge is our kin. Knowledge is verily the supreme Divine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nīti śatakam, Verse 20</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Access to Information is foundational in developing a Conscious Global Society</strong> and a University.</p>
<p>Every nation is recognized by what it cherishes as its wealth and treasury. The Hindus have preserved the temples and the scriptures as its greatest wealth, heritage, upon stood the knowledge transmission systems. The true wealth of Hindu Traditions are its timeless Scriptures (Shastra), which have been delicately and devotedly preserved by many generations, vouchsafed as divine inheritance. &nbsp;The foreign cultural invasion to India, brought the barbarous destruction of the Hindu scripture texts and manuscripts, the greatest Knowledge Systems. Through inhumane massacres by Casteist Invaders, the Major Hindu Libraries at Hindu Universities were burnt down to ashes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with the rapid pace of change in India there has been an alarmingly rapid loss of ancient Source information on Hinduism. Many of the powerful repositories of information in the Vedic system, the scriptures, are not being Digitized or preserved in for future. India is richest in repository of old and rare texts and manuscripts on Hinduism but is also forerunner in conservation efforts in modern times. Earlier all these text and manuscripts were treated as deity and given utmost care. As a decreasing interest and continuous attack by invaders, India has lost respect to these texts and manuscripts. All these texts and manuscripts are suffering due to lack of proper maintenance.It is this loss of vast amounts of potent information that is being directly addressed by Nithyananda Jnanalaya Hindu Scripture, a division of Nithyananda Hindu University. NJHS is undertaking the task of locating, acquiring, collecting, digitizing, preserving and disseminating vast banks of Cosmic information for every Human being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The goal is to create the largest repository of Hindu scriptural knowledge, Cosmic information in the world.</strong></p>
