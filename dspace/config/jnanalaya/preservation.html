<h2>Preservation and Conservation</h2>
<p><strong> PRESERVATION AND CONSERVATION OF MANUSCRIPTS</strong></p>
<p>The processes of preservation and conservation are applied to safeguard physical and historical integrity of manuscript. They increase longevity of the integrity of manuscripts.</p>
<p>Generally, the two terms &lsquo;Preservation&rsquo; and &lsquo;Conservation&rsquo; are used synonymously. Technically, these two words have different connotations but they are related to each other. Preservation generally means keeping an object from harmful effect such as loss, destruction and the like. It is the process in which all actions are taken to retard deterioration of the manuscript or to prevent damage to manuscripts. It involves controlling the environment and conditions of use; and may include treatment in order to maintain manuscripts, as much as possible, in an unchanging state.</p>
<p>Whereas, Conservation is the process in which all actions are aimed at the safeguarding of manuscripts for the future. The purpose of conservation is to study, record, retain and restore the intervention. Conservation includes examination, documentation, preventive conservation, preservation, restoration and reconstruction. Conservation focuses on three basic aspects, namely examination, preservation and restoration. Manuscripts are often old and preserve texts which are otherwise lost or readings which are forgotten. Therefore, they need special care and attention in order to be preserved for the future generations.</p>

<h4>How we Do conservation of Source books?</h4>
<p>India is richest in repository of old and rare texts and manuscripts but is also forerunner in conservation efforts in modern times. Earlier all these text and manuscripts were treated as deity and given utmost care. As a decreasing interest and continuous attack by invaders, India has lost respect to these texts and manuscripts. All these manuscripts are suffering due to lack of proper maintenance. Nithyananda Jnanalaya took this project very seriously. It has trained more than 20 people in preserving the sacred texts.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts encompass the following dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conservation of&nbsp;original Manuscripts through various physical and chemical treatments</li>
<li>Conservation through digitization</li>
<li>Conservation though making multiple copy by printing on palm-leaf</li>
</ul>
