<h2>Digitization</h2>
<h4>Digitization Process in Nithyananda Jnanalaya</h4>
<p>Digitization means acquiring, converting, storing and providing information in a computer format that is standardized, organised and available on demand from common system. Books and Manuscripts are converted into compressed digital formats with specialized scanners and stored systematically for future reference</p>
<h4>Why Digitize?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A long term digitally "future-proofed" safe location for your content on the web.</li>
<li>To promote access to books and manuscripts.</li>
<li>For preservation in a longer lasting medium and creating a backup copy with as close a resemblance to the original as possible.</li>
<li>To reduce handling of very fragile or frequently used original Source Books.</li>
<li>This vast archival resource will be accessible to users through the Nithyananda Jnanalaya Hindu Scripture Digital Repository.</li>
<li>To re-print the similar copy on palm-leaf for future uses, maintaining the traditional way of keeping the knowledge system alive.</li>

<p><em> "When the original scriptures, Vedas, were hidden into the ocean by the demon Hiranya, Varaha Avatara happened. Vishnu took the incarnation and brought those scriptures out and revealed it to the world. Now it is my responsibility - collecting it from all the corners of the world wherever it was secretly lying, the original agamas, the yogic scriptures and gathering it, revealing it to the whole world and making it available to the whole world through the internet. We are successful in collecting more than 3 Terabyte original material on Yoga &ndash; Revelations by Sadashiva. And we are scanning everything, cleaning it up. We are ready with original material &ndash; scanned palm leaves &ndash; revelations about Yoga by Sadashiva and his direct disciples. We will offer this to the whole world copyright free. You have a right to copy. I am declaring it as copyright free. If you are copying, not only are you welcome, you are celebrated."</em></p>
