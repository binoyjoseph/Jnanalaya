<h3>HIS MISSION</h3>
<p>His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam, as per Hinduism, is an Incarnation (Avatar) of MahaSadashiva - the all-pervading superconscious energy, the source of all that exists and the original author of &lsquo;<em>VedaAgamas</em>&rsquo;, which are the Pure Science and Applied Science of Oneness (Advaita), Yoga, Enlightenment and Enlightened lifestyle. As the Vision documents for humanity, the <em>VedaAgamas</em> scientifically and systematically reveal all knowledge currents, ritual methodologies, lifestyle systems and Yogic sciences.</p>

<li>To pioneer a divine evolution, awakening human beings to their extraordinary powers (shaktis) and powerful cognitions (from higher states of Consciousness), building the next level frequency of human body, mind, internal organs and intra organs (such as Third Eye).</li>
<li>To empower humanity to manifest Superconscious powers at individual, societal and global levels.</li>
<li>To re-create a Conscious world where the global issues at the climatic, economic, social, health and humanitarian levels, cease to exist from their very root; turning the problems of poverty, hunger, violence, discrimination into powerful living through the experience of Oneness.</li>
</ul>

<li>In September 2011, researchers studied the phenomenon of materialization and kundalini awakening using whole body CT scan and QEEG machine, and scientifically validated (1) that the brain waves change significantly from alpha to delta waves during kundalini awakening, and (2) verified that materliazation of objects indeed can be recorded on the CT scan.</li>
<li>QEEG studies conducted by neurologists showed that during kundalini awakening the brain waves changed in a way that may increase focus, awareness, improve memory, problem solving and decision making abilities.</li>
<li>Other research has focused on <em>Nirahara Samyama </em>&ndash; the meditation and process to beyond food, and the patterns related to food.</li>
