<p>The 16th Chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, 24th Shloka says:</p>
<div id="originalVerse">
<p style="text-align: center;">तस्माच्छास्त्रं प्रमाणं ते कार्याकार्यव्यवस्थितौ |<br />ज्ञात्वा शास्त्रविधानोक्तं कर्म कर्तुमिहार्हसि || 24||</p>
</div>
<div id="transliteration">
<p style="text-align: center;">tasmāch chhāstraṁ pramāṇaṁ te kāryākārya-vyavasthitau<br />j&ntilde;ātvā śhāstra-vidhānoktaṁ karma kartum ihārhasi<br /><br /><em>Therefore, let the scriptures be your authority in determining what should be done and what should not be done.</em><br /><em>Understand the scriptural injunctions and teachings, and then perform your actions in this world accordingly.</em></p>
</div>
