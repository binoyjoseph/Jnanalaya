<h3>Vision and Mission for Kailaasa Nithyananda Jnanalaya Hindu Scriptures</h3>
<p><strong>His Divine Holiness Sri Paramahamsa Nithyananda&rsquo;s vision for the Vedic Grantha Samadhi - Nithyananda Jnanalaya Hindu Scriptures</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;A civilization is made up of its Gods, Scriptures, rituals and tenets that are lived. These aspects provide the vatavarana (environment) where human beings flourish in whichever dimension of life they are passionate about. Sanatana Hindu Dharma is the oldest living civilization on planet earth. This glorious civilization had about 1,000,000,00 source books, most of which is lost due to various invasion. One source book is sufficient for a religion to emerge. For most of these books, there are bhashyas (commentaries), tikas (commentaries on commentary), and varthikas (commentaries on tikas). There are more than 32 different types of commentaries that exist in Sanatana Hindu Dharma. Each and every source book can be commented in more than thousand ways by permutation and combination of various types of writing. Imagine the richness of this tradition.</p>
<p>In this digital age, Sanatana Hindu Dharma is hardly understood even by Hindus as the amount of digitization of Hindu scriptures is a very small percentage of what is even available or known. Translation of our scriptures to commonly used languages of this day is another issue in accessing these treasures of our ancient and ever-relevant wisdom.</p>
<p>It is very unfortunate; Hindus spend so much money on building temples, but we don&rsquo;t invest on building libraries. Libraries are a low priority. This is also one reason why we have become weak. The reason for why we have been weakened is we spend so much money on building temples and not enough on libraries.</p>
<p>I want educating organizations, educational tools, knowledge transmission methodologies, knowledge transmission apparatus, knowledge transmission systems to be available. I want that. The Kailaasa Nithyananda Jnanalaya Hindu Scriptures, is a step to start addressing these issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The purpose is to integrate the scattered knowledge of Hinduism across several location into one large web, in the Kailaasa Nithyananda Jnanalaya Hindu Scriptures repository.</p>
<p><em> "It&rsquo;s our job to build beautiful libraries, the knowledge transferring methodologies and mechanisms, &hellip; Not only library; making the library user-friendly, useful to people, where people can really, really get involved, know more about it, making it more visually presenting. Please understand, human-beings have started learning visually now. Almost all learning process has become visual; less words more visual presentation. We should work on creating video encyclopedia of Hinduism."</em></p>
